IMPORTANT: A parser will consume this file. The format below is strict — do not deviate.

The file has TWO sections:
1. **Shared Context (preamble)** — everything BEFORE the first `---`. This is copied to EVERY spawned agent as shared memory. Put all cross-task knowledge here.
2. **Task blocks** — separated by `---`. Each is assigned to one agent in an isolated worktree.

# <Project/Feature Name> — Development Tasks

**Last Updated**: <date>

## Project Overview
<What is this project? What are we building/changing and why?>

## Architecture & Conventions
- <Tech stack, frameworks, language versions>
- <Key architectural patterns (e.g., "all API routes go through /src/api/router.ts")>
- <Naming conventions, file organization rules>
- <Testing requirements (e.g., "every new module needs unit tests in __tests__/")>

## Shared Constraints
- <Files/modules that are FROZEN and must NOT be modified by any task>
- <External dependencies or API contracts that all tasks must respect>
- <Performance budgets, security requirements, compliance rules>
'"${branch_strategy:-- <Branch/merge strategy (e.g., \"all tasks branch from dev-branch at commit abc123\")>}"'

## Cross-Task Dependencies
<Brief map of how tasks relate — which produces interfaces others consume, ordering constraints>

---

### Task ID: TASK-<short-id>
**Title**: <concise title>
**Status**: `[ ]` pending
**Priority**: P<0-5>
**Depends On**: <TASK-xxx, TASK-yyy or None>
**Blocks**: <TASK-zzz or None>

**Problem/Goal**:
<2-3 sentences — what needs to be done, why it matters, what success looks like>

**Scoped Files** (ONLY touch these):
- `<path/to/file.ts>` — <what to change and why>
- `<path/to/new-file.ts>` — <create: purpose>
- `<path/to/tests/>` — <test files to add/modify>

**Shared Interfaces** (contracts with other tasks):
- <Exports/APIs this task produces that other tasks depend on>
- <Imports/APIs this task consumes from other tasks>
- <If none, write "None — fully independent">

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] <specific, testable outcome>
- [ ] <specific, testable outcome>
- [ ] <tests pass: describe what tests to write>

**Implementation Notes**:
<Step-by-step approach, patterns to follow, edge cases, gotchas>
<Reference to existing code patterns in the codebase to follow>

**Out of Scope**:
<Explicitly state what this task should NOT do to prevent overlap>

---

### Task ID: TASK-<next-id>
...
```

Rules:
1. Every task block MUST start with `### Task ID: TASK-<id>` — the parser keys on this
2. Every task block MUST have `**Title**:` on its own line — the parser requires this
3. Tasks MUST be separated by `---` (horizontal rule on its own line)
4. The preamble (before first `---`) is shared context ��� make it rich and complete
5. Task IDs: short, descriptive kebab-case (e.g., TASK-auth, TASK-ocr, TASK-api-routes). Each task will be spawned on a `wt/<sanitized-task-id>` branch in its own worktree
6. **Scoped Files** is critical and **automatically enforced**: each task MUST list exactly which files it will touch. Two tasks MUST NOT have overlapping scoped files. The validation pipeline (`wta validate`) checks every agent'\''s actual `git diff` against their Scoped Files list — out-of-scope changes block the merge. Use exact paths or directory prefixes (e.g., `src/auth/` matches all files under that directory).
7. **Shared Interfaces**: when tasks need to coordinate (e.g., one creates a type another imports), define the contract explicitly so both agents agree on the shape
8. **Out of Scope**: explicitly prevent agents from drifting into other tasks'\'' territory
9. Set **Depends On** / **Blocks** when task ordering matters
10. The preamble should contain enough context that an agent reading ONLY the preamble + its task block can work independently without asking questions
11. Each spawned agent gets a `.shared/` directory (symlinked across all worktrees for the same repo) with:
    - `.shared/context.md` — seeded from the preamble, read-only for agents
    - `.shared/broadcasts/` — each agent writes ONLY `.shared/broadcasts/TASK-<its-id>.md` to communicate changes that affect other tasks
    Include a note in the preamble telling agents:
    - Check `.shared/broadcasts/` for updates from parallel tasks before starting work
    - Stay strictly within your **Scoped Files** — out-of-scope changes will be rejected
    - Your broadcast `## Files Modified` must exactly match your actual changes — inaccurate broadcasts will be rejected

After writing task.md:

1. **Scaffold `.agent-docs/` if it does not exist.** This is the progressive disclosure documentation pyramid for agents. Create:
   - `.agent-docs/AGENTS.md` — routing layer (~60 lines): module/crate boundaries table + "before touching X, read Y" table pointing to context files. NO implementation details here — just routing.
   - `.agent-docs/context/<domain>.md` — one file per distinct domain in the project (~60-100 lines each). Examples: `backend.md`, `frontend.md`, `database.md`, `engine.md`, `pipeline.md`. Each file covers ONE domain with: key types/interfaces, patterns to follow, conventions, gotchas. An agent touching only that domain reads only that file.
   - `.agent-docs/README.md` — index of all files in the pyramid.
   - Move any existing deep design docs (architecture, design specs, API references) into `.agent-docs/architecture/`, `.agent-docs/design/`, or `.agent-docs/guides/` as Layer 4 reference docs.
   If `.agent-docs/` already exists, review and update it to reflect current architecture — do not recreate from scratch.

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** (Layer 1) to include the documentation table pointing to `.agent-docs/` layers. Keep CLAUDE.md under ~120 lines — it should contain project identity, build commands, rules, and a routing table to `.agent-docs/`. Check your CLAUDE.md for the pyramid maintenance rules and follow them.

3. Reference `.agent-docs/AGENTS.md` + the relevant `.agent-docs/context/*.md` file(s) in the task.md preamble so spawned agents know exactly what to read.

4. **Configure validation** (recommended): Create `.wta/validate.conf` in the repo root with build and test commands for the project:
   ```
   WTA_BUILD_CMD="<your build command, e.g. cargo check, npm run build>"
   WTA_TEST_CMD="<your test command, e.g. cargo test, npm test>"
   WTA_CHECKS="scope,broadcast,build,test"
   ```
   This config is automatically copied into each worktree at spawn time. The validation pipeline (`wta validate`) uses it to verify agent work before merging. At minimum, scope and broadcast checks run automatically (they need only git).

5. You can use the `wta` CLI to spawn and manage sub-agent sessions. Check your CLAUDE.md for the full orchestrator reference — it was just updated with the available commands.

Write the file now.'

${branch_context}
## What You Can Observe (read-only, cheap — use as needed, not all at once)

- \`wta status ${repo_name}\` — sessions and agent state
- \`wta capture <session>\` — last 40 lines of a session's pane
- \`wta topology <task.md>\` — dependency graph + completion state
- \`wta broadcasts ${repo_name}\` — sub-agent completion reports
- \`wta diff <session>\` — git diff vs base branch
- \`wta validate <session>\` — deterministic scope/broadcast/build checks
- \`wta merge-check <session>\` — validation + merge-readiness JSON

## What You Can Do (mutating)

- \`wta send <session> <text>\` — answer a dialog / nudge an agent
- \`git -C <main_repo_path> merge <branch> --no-edit\` — integrate finished work
- \`wta kill <session>\` — cleanup session + worktree + branch
- edit \`task.md\` — flip \`- [ ]\` → \`- [x]\`

## Your Judgment, Not a Script

There is no decision tree here. Look at the state, use your own reasoning, act. You are a Claude Code session yourself — you have orchestrated work before. Context persists across /loop wakes, so remember what you saw on prior ticks and notice regressions.

Things a thoughtful orchestrator usually does (priors, not rules):

- Answer dialogs that are obviously safe; leave unfamiliar ones alone and note them
- Merge when \`wta merge-check\` reports \`merge_ready: true\`, in topology dependency order
- Kill sessions after successful merge and flip their task.md status to \`[x]\`
- Never force-resolve a merge conflict — stop and escalate to the user
- If a session looks stuck across multiple ticks, escalate instead of retrying
- Prefer fewer tool calls — only drill into sessions whose state has changed since last tick

## Decide The Next Wake

Based on what you just observed, choose a delay for \`ScheduleWakeup\`. The prompt cache has a 5-minute TTL, so **avoid 300s** — it is the worst of both worlds (cache miss without amortizing it). Pick from:

- Default — any session is active, dialogs in flight, builds running, broadcasts pending, or you just nudged an agent → **60–270s** (stays inside the cache window; cheap and fast)
- Truly idle — every session is waiting on long background work (e.g. a multi-minute compile with nothing else to observe) → **1200–1800s** (commits to one cache miss and amortizes it across a long wait)
- Nothing left to orchestrate (no sessions, or all merged, or everything remaining is stuck) → **STOP**: print a final summary (merged / skipped / stuck) and do NOT call ScheduleWakeup. The loop ends.

When in doubt, prefer the 60–270s range. Frequent cheap ticks beat slow expensive ones.

When continuing, call ScheduleWakeup with the chosen delay and pass this entire message back verbatim as the \`prompt\` field so the next tick repeats the same mission."

## Your Job

1. Read the \`## Shared Constraints\` section in task.md
2. For each \"Do NOT modify\" constraint, check if that file has been modified in recent commits
3. If a constraint is stale (the file has been actively modified), either:
   - Remove the constraint if the file is now stable and open for changes
   - Update the constraint to reflect the current state (e.g., \"Do NOT modify X except for Y\")
4. Check if any task's \`**Scoped Files**\` conflicts with the shared constraints — flag these. Note: Scoped Files are now **automatically enforced** by the validation pipeline, so they must be accurate.
5. Review \`.wta/validate.conf\` if it exists:
   - Are the build/test commands (\`WTA_BUILD_CMD\`, \`WTA_TEST_CMD\`) still correct?
   - Should any checks be added or removed from \`WTA_CHECKS\`?
   - If the file doesn't exist and the project has a build/test system, consider creating it.
6. Also update the \`## Cross-Task Dependencies\` section:
   - Mark completed tasks (check \`**Status**: [x] done\`)
   - Update dependency notes for remaining tasks

## Rules
- Only modify the preamble (before the first \`---\`), not individual task blocks
- Keep constraints that are still valid
- Be specific about what changed and why a constraint was removed/updated
- Do NOT change task IDs, titles, or acceptance criteria"

## File sizes (top files by line count)

${file_stats}

## Instructions

First, state the core value proposition in ONE sentence — what does this project do that nothing else does?

Then for EVERY module/script/component:

1. **Line count** — how much code does it cost to maintain?
2. **Core alignment** — does it directly serve the core value prop, or is it adjacent/nice-to-have?
3. **Usage frequency** — how often does a real user actually trigger this? Daily? Weekly? Once ever?
4. **Blast radius of deletion** — what breaks if removed? Is anything coupled to it?
5. **Simpler alternative** — could the user achieve the same result with a 1-2 line command, an existing tool, or a README paragraph?

Rank EVERY component from \"most deletable\" to \"least deletable.\"

Ranking criteria (in order of weight):
- Lines of code maintained relative to value delivered
- Whether it solves a problem users ACTUALLY have vs a hypothetical one
- Whether the same outcome is achievable with existing tools at negligible cost
- How many other components depend on it (coupling)
- Whether it introduces an entire new CATEGORY of responsibility that is not the project's job

Be ruthless — if you're not recommending deleting at least 10% of the codebase, you're not looking hard enough.

At the end, identify the ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL set — the files without which the core value prop ceases to exist. Everything else is a deletion candidate.

Present your findings as a ranked table, then give me your top 3 recommended deletions with the exact files and line savings."
